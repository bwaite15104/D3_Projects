1. Ease to Develop
	Tableu: Easiest because you only drag pills and make small edits for full interactive visualizations.
	ggplot2(R): Some coding is involved, but requires few lines of code to develop.
	D3: Hardest because of the large amount of coding involved and specific requirements.

2. Ease to maintain 
	Tableau: Easiest because you only edit the location of pills or different features.
	ggplot2(R): Some coding is involved, but somewhat easy because of the small amount.
	D3: Hardest because of the large amount of code that may need updating.

3. Usability
	D3: Easiest because you can customize every aspect of the visualization.
	Tableau: You can make the visualizations interactive but can not customize everything.
	ggplot2(R): Does not have built in features for interactivity and involves additional libraries to do so.

4. Scalability 
	D3: Best because it performs very fast with large datasets and allows asynchronous loading.
	ggplot2(R): Worse because of R's limitations with larger data.
	Tableau: Worst because it takes a long time to load many data points and typically relies on already summarized data.

5. System requirements
	D3: Best because it is opensource and runs on every major OS/browser.
	ggplot2(R): Depends on how you deploy your visualization. If you deployed using RShiny then it requires licensing.
	Tableau: Worst because it is not opensource and requires user expensive licenses.
